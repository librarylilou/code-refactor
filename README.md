This week has introduced me to an environment similar to a programmers occupation within a company. The assignment provides an established code and my work is to read and finess the HTML and CSS documents. In completing this task I learned how the HTML and CSS documents correspond with one another through reading and organizing their semantic structure. 

The following explains the methods I took for each document.    

## On the HTML Document:

In order to achieve this, I first started with  opening the HTML file in the default browser to get a visual representation of the website. From the HTML source code I revised the structure and had the elements organized in a logical structure, apart from styling and positioning. 
This includes, adding alt attributes to the image elements, checking for a sequential order in the heading attributes, and giving a concise and descriptive title as the company's name.

## On the CSS Document:

My method for the CSS document was to begin with checking that all the IDs were being utilized and had a style function, to match the IDs provided from the HTML document. Once I cleared out the IDs that were dead weight to the CSS document, I continued to organize the semantic structure to match the order of the HTML document. So, as you scroll down the web page or the HTML document from top to bottom in sequential order, the styling functions of the CSS document correspond accordingly.

## Links and Screens
The website is a dedicated source that ensures access to those with disabilities by providing the option to video captions. Want to see?!
